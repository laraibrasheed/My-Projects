Words to Number Converter 
A simple Python project that converts numbers written in English words into their corresponding integer values.

About
This project takes a number written as a string, such as:"Two Thousand"
and converts it into:2000
It supports basic numbers, tens, hundreds, and larger number units such as thousand, million, and billion.

Some working Examples
Example 1
Input: Two Thousand
Output: 2000

Example 2
Input: Eight Million
Output: 8000000

Example 3
Input: Three Hundred Twenty Five
Output: 325

How It Works
The program uses Python dictionaries to map English number words to their numerical values.
For example:
"two" → 2
"twenty" → 20
"hundred" → 100
"thousand" → 1000
"million" → 1000000

The input string is:
Converted to lowercase.
Split into individual words.
Processed word by word.
Combined using the appropriate mathematical operations.
Returned as an integer.

For example:
"Two Thousand Five Hundred"
is processed as:
Two       → 2
Thousand  → ×1000
Adding it to
Five      → 5
Hundred   → ×100

Result:
2500
